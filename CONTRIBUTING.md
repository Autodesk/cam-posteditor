## What types of contributions do we accept?
We are currently accepting bug fix contributions but we are always open to your suggestions. 

We are in the process of experimenting with the new G-code debugger functionality.
If this proves useful, then some re-architecturing will be required before we can open this up further.
Please contact us if you would like to contribute to this.
